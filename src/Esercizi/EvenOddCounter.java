 * Write a program with a method named isEven() that accepts an int argument. The
 * method should return true if the argument is even, or false if otherwise. The
 * program's main method should use a loop to generate 100 random integers. It
 * should use the isEven method to determine whether each random number is even,
 * or odd. When the loop is finished, the program should display the number of
 * even and odd numbers that were generated.
